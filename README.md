# Cinema-app

This project is a web application for a cinema. It allows users to view the schedule of movie sessions and purchase tickets for them. The application also has a user registration system, as well as a secure section with access rights to various resources, based on user roles. Additionally, users can obtain information about movies available at the cinema, including their descriptions.
The program is developed in accordance with the REST concept using such technologies as `Hibernate` and `Spring`.
